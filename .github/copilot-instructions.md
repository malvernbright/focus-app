# Focus App

- The aim of the Focus App is to help users concentrate on their tasks by minimizing distractions.
- The app should provide a clean and simple interface that allows users to focus on their work.
- Users should be able to set timers for work sessions and breaks.
- The app should include features like a to-do list, reminders, and progress tracking.
- Users should be able to define projects and tasks they're working on, together with the expected hours to complete them. After completing a task, users can log the actual hours spent.
- Users should be able to define breaks and the app should remind them to take breaks at defined time.
- The design should be intuitive, with easy navigation and minimal clutter.

# Tasks

- Implement a timer feature that allows users to set work sessions and breaks.
- Create a to-do list feature where users can add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Develop a project management feature where users can define projects, tasks, expected hours, and log actual hours spent.
- Implement reminders for breaks and work sessions.
- Design a user-friendly interface that is visually appealing and easy to navigate.
- Make use of animations where necessary to enhance user experience.
- I also need and option for an alarm at the end of each task
- Each timer started should show time moving in real time

# Libraries and Tools

- Consider using a better state management for better separation of concerns.
- Use a local database (like SQLite) to store user data such as tasks, projects, and timers.
- Use a package for notifications to remind users about breaks and work sessions.
- Notifications are paramount to the app's functionality, so ensure they are implemented correctly.
- Notifications should show up even when the app is in the background or closed.
- Notifications should show at the end each defined task, and at the end of each work session.
